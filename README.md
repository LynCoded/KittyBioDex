# KittyBioDex
A Cryptokitties bio bot creating interesting (and funny) kitty bios for the Kittyverse to use.

### Kitty Bios, AI Style
I love the biographies for each kitty on the Cryptokitties site, so much so that I wanted to replicate the pattern I observed through different cat descriptions. I thought that automating the kitty bios would not only be fun, but a help to devs. 

### Usage
This Twitter bot was built using Tracery and Cheap Bots Done Quick. To implement, use the [Tracery JSON](http://air.decontextualize.com/tracery/) file as your script in Tracery and change the #origin# sentence to reflect your story. Change the phrases, adjectives, and nouns to create your own script, then plug it into Cheap Bots Done Quick with your own Twitter credentials to use.

### Share, iterate, and make! 
I encourage you to use my script to make your own Twitter bot, or to add new phrases to mine via pull request. The bot can be found live at http://twitter.com/KBioDex !
